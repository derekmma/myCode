This repository contains few codes which were given to us as assignments for our High Performance Computing course in the third semester of my Masters degree.
The codes were written using MPI

1. mat_vec.c : Matrix vector multiplication using 1d block partitioning 
               of the Input Matrix
               ( The matrix and vector are supplied as seperate files
                 via command line arguments. The code expects the files 
                 to be space seperated with a new line character
                 terminating each row of the matrix. The vector is 
                 required to be stored as a row vector following the same
                 convention as for the matrix. )
