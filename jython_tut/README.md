A project that I am currently working on requires me to work with the Stanford CoreNLP suite for Natural Language Processing Analysis. The suite is written in Java and comes with mentions of wrappers in many languages.

I (naturally) looked at Python Wrappers; unfortunately, I didn't find them all that straightforward to use. Also, there were other constraints with regard to integration of the NLP analysis with the rest of the project.

*Enter Jython*

I found this quintessenial quiet, working in the shadows overachiever after quite the manhunt. And I thought I'd give a quick and dry introductory script to use CoreNLP in conjunction with Jython to evaluate the sentiment of a single sentence.
